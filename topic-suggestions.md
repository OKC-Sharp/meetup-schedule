# Topic Suggestions

All topic suggestions should be related to C# and/or .NET.  Cross-talks related to Visual Design, Work Experience, Databases, DevOps, Human Resources, Project Management, and other Development-Adjacent categories should have an obvious connection with development, and specifically with C#/.NET.

## Developer Talks (Can be Long or Lightning)
